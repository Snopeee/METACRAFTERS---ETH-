It's not entirely clear which transaction you are referring to. However, in general, a transaction in a smart contract can throw an error
if it encounters an unexpected situation or if certain conditions are not met.

For example, a transaction can throw an error if:

1. The caller of the function does not have sufficient permissions or is not authorized to perform the action

2. The function requires certain input parameters that are not provided or are invalid

3. The function encounters an unexpected situation or error during its execution, such as a division by zero or an out-of-bounds array access

4. The function attempts to modify state in a way that violates the contract's rules or constraints, such as transferring more funds than are available or changing a read-only variable.

When a transaction throws an error, it will typically revert any changes made to the contract's state and return an error message or code indicating the reason for the failure. 
The caller of the function can then take appropriate action based on the error, such as retrying the transaction with different input parameters or displaying an error message to the user.
